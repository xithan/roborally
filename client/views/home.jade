              | Imagine that you're a supercomputer. Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that..

              | In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.
              | RoboRally is a multiplayer turn based strategy game.
